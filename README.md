# HDS
The Hazard Detection System (HDS) is a low-cost, versatile, IoT invention that detects when a person is about to venture into a dangerous area and alerts him/her to prevent potential accidents.

The idea of this project came in 12th grade when I lost a friend. After paying his family a condolence visit, I found that he died from electrocution because he attempted to change an electric switch but had no idea that it was naked and that there was water on the floor. On hearing this, I started thinking to myself, “How could this tragedy have been prevented?” “How can I use my maker experience to create something that can deter future occurrences?”

After thorough introspection, I came up with the idea for the HDS and I was able to use my maker skills to integrate several components to make it work. The HDS uses Arduino microcontrollers, Ultrasonic Distance Sensors, LCDs, Piezoelectric Buzzers, and LEDs to work. Here’s how it works: I specify a particular “Danger Zone” and if someone encroaches upon that area my ultrasonic sensor picks up the person’s movements, transmits the signal to the Piezoelectric buzzer, LCD, and LED which then rings an alarm alerting the person, displays a text saying “Danger Ahead Please Stay Back”, and blinks rapidly to tell the person to stay back, respectively.

The HDS is currently open-source for anyone that wants to remotely build it for personal application. In the nearest future, I intend to scale the HDS to impact a greater number of people.
